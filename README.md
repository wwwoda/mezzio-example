## Application Development Mode Tool

This skeleton comes with [laminas-development-mode](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-development-mode). 
It provides a composer script to allow you to enable and disable development mode.

### To enable development mode

**Note:** Do NOT run development mode on your production server!

```bash
$ composer development-enable
```

**Note:** Enabling development mode will also clear your configuration cache, to 
allow safely updating dependencies and ensuring any new configuration is picked 
up by your application.

### To disable development mode

```bash
$ composer development-disable
```

### Development mode status

```bash
$ composer development-status
```

### Doctrine cli

```bash
$ composer doctrine
```
